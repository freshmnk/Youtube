YouTube Landing Page - HTML & CSS Practice
This project is a replica of the YouTube landing page, built solely with HTML and CSS for the purpose of practicing and testing my skills in these languages. It does not have any functionalities and is purely a visual representation of the YouTube homepage.
What's included:
* index.html: This file contains the HTML structure of the landing page, including elements like the header, hero section, content blocks, and footer.
* style.css: This file holds the CSS styles that define the visual appearance of the page, including colors, fonts, layout, and spacing.
Note:
* This project is for demonstration purposes only and is not intended to be a fully functional website.
* It does not include any JavaScript or server-side code.
Feel free to:
* Explore the code and see how HTML and CSS are used to create the layout and styling.
* Modify the code to experiment with different design elements and functionalities (using additional languages like JavaScript).
I hope this project serves as a helpful example of how HTML and CSS can be used to build visually appealing web pages.
